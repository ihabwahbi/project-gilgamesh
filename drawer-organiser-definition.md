# Drawer Organiser

## Overview

Drawer Organiser is a single-login ADC ecosystem that centralises everything candidates actually need to prepare for the Australian Dental Council (ADC) examinations and transition into professional practice. The platform brings together community, study tools, and career pathways in one cohesive environment—replacing the fragmented landscape of WhatsApp groups, Facebook forums, and informal networks.

## Core Features

### 48 OSCE Case Rooms

Dedicated discussion spaces aligned with each OSCE case, featuring Reddit-style posts and comments. Candidates can ask questions, share insights, and engage in structured conversations organised by examination topic.

### Global Feed

A centralised activity stream that surfaces relevant discussions, updates, and community activity across the platform.

### Study Partner Matching

A matching system that connects candidates based on:

- **Location** — Find local study partners in your city or state
- **Stage** — Match with candidates at similar points in their ADC journey
- **Availability** — Connect with partners whose schedules align with yours
- **Connection Requests** — Send and manage partnership requests

## Drawer Organiser Recruit

Recruit is a recruitment layer built on top of the community platform, designed to connect ADC candidates, provisional dentists, and newly registered dentists with dental clinics for real employment opportunities.

### The Problem It Solves

Currently, candidates transitioning from study to employment rely on random Facebook posts, informal networks, and word-of-mouth. Clinics seeking ADC-pathway dentists have no structured channel to reach this specific audience. Both sides lose time and miss opportunities.

### The Advantage

Drawer Organiser already holds the exact audience clinics want to hire. Candidates get a safer, more structured path from "studying" to "employment" without navigating unreliable informal channels.

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Simple job listings posted by dental clinics
- Basic candidate profiles showcasing qualifications, location, and availability
- Browse and enquire functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Matching

- Verified profiles for candidates and clinics
- Filtering by location, availability, and skills
- Shortlisting and saved candidates/roles

### Phase 3: Full Recruitment Workflow

- Interview scheduling tools
- Placement support and tracking
- Feedback and review systems

## Compliance & Privacy

### "No Exam Content" Policy

The platform operates under strict compliance rules to protect the integrity of the ADC examination process:

- Clear community rules prohibiting exam content sharing
- User reporting mechanisms for policy violations
- Active admin moderation across all spaces

### Privacy by Default

- User profiles are private by default
- Candidates control what information is visible
- Opt-in visibility for recruitment and matching features

### Mentor Verification

Mentor status requires verification to ensure credibility of verified answers and guidance within the community.

## Phased Development Approach

The platform is designed to prove real usage before adding complexity. The following features are deliberately postponed until the pilot demonstrates genuine engagement:

| Postponed Feature | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Payment Integration | Validate demand before monetisation |
| Provider Directory | Build community first, then expand ecosystem |
| Marketplace | Ensure core features are stable and adopted |
| Points & Gamification | Focus on utility over engagement mechanics |
| Advanced Recruit Features | Start simple, scale with proven usage |

## Summary

Drawer Organiser is built around what ADC candidates actually need: structured study discussions, meaningful peer connections, and a clear pathway from preparation to employment. By starting lean and proving value at each stage, the platform avoids feature bloat while creating a foundation for sustainable growth.
